#### Gulp
A gulp.js config file is included on the root folder, to help build the project.

##### To install Gulp:
[node.js]{http://nodejs.org/} is required. Once you have node.js installed, install `gulp` globally:
```
npm install gulp --global
```

##### To install dependecies:
Navigate to the project's root folder and install dependencies via `npm`:
```
npm install
```

##### Usage
* `gulp` for a list of commands
* `gulp build` to build the production files
* `gulp watch` to watch changes on the code, and build if necessary.
* `gulp serve` to watch changes and push the changes via Browser-sync.
